JS Assignment 1: Guess the Number

Reasons why I will remove points:

- You don't have three files (1 HTML, 1 CSS, 1 JavaScript).
- You have an error in any of your files.
- When you make guesses, the text that says "Guess a number between 1 and 25 to see if it's correct" does not get replaced.
(In other words, the text should change and display if you need to guess higher, lower, or if it's correct.)
- The game is not centered in the middle of the screen.
- You don't have meaningful variable names.
- Indentation is incorrect in any of the files.
- You are not using the terminal in order to upload files to GitHub.
- Color of the status text does not change to green or red depending whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
